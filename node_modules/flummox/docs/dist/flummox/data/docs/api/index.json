These are not part of the main export. That way, if you don't use them, they won't increase the size of your bundle.\n\n* [FluxComponent](api/fluxcomponent.md)\n* [fluxMixin](api/fluxmixin.md)\n* [Higher-order component](api/higher-order-component.md)\n\nRefer to the [React integration guide](../guides/react-integration.md) for details.\n\n```js\nimport fluxMixin from 'flummox/mixin';\nimport FluxComponent from 'flummox/component';\nimport connectToStores from 'flummox/connect';\n```\n"}
