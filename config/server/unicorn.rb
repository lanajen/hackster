# Unicorn configuration file to be running by unicorn_init.sh with capistrano task
# read an example configuration before: http://unicorn.bogomips.org/examples/unicorn.redis_conf.rb
#
# working_directory, pid, paths - internal Unicorn variables must to setup
# worker_process 4              - is good enough for serve small production application
# timeout 30                    - time limit when unresponded workers to restart
# preload_app true              - the most interesting option that confuse a lot of us,
#                                 just setup is as true always, it means extra work on
#                                 deployment scripts to make it correctly
# BUNDLE_GEMFILE                - make Gemfile accessible with new master
# before_fork, after_fork       - reconnect to all dependent services: DB, Redis, Sphinx etc.
#                                 deal with old_pid only if CPU or RAM are limited enough

# The timeout mechanism in Unicorn is an extreme solution that should be avoided whenever possible.
# It will help catch bugs in your application where and when your application forgets to use timeouts,
# but it is expensive as it kills and respawns a worker process.
# see http://unicorn.bogomips.org/Application_Timeouts.html

# Heroku recommends a timeout of 15 seconds. With a 15 second timeout, the master process will send a
# SIGKILL to the worker process if processing a request takes longer than 15 seconds. This will
# generate a H13 error code and youâ€™ll see it in your logs. Note, this will not generate any stacktraces
# to assist in debugging. Using Rack::Timeout, we can get a stacktrace in the logs that can be used for
# future debugging, so we set that value to something less than this one
