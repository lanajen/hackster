<p>It's now time for you to share your own projects! We've made it really easy to get started:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Do you have existing project logs on your personal site?</b> Import them by going to <a href="http://www.hackster.io/projects/new">the showcase page</a> and entering the article URL at the bottom.</li>
    <li><b>Starting from scratch?</b> <a href="http://www.hackster.io/projects/new">Creating a project is super easy</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  We're excited to see what you've done!
