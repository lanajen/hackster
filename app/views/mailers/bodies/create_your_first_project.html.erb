<p>Hi |user_informal_name|</p>

<p>I hope you've been finding useful and interesting hardware projects on Hackster.io.</p>

<p>It's now time for you to share your own projects! Getting started is easy:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Have you already documented projects on your personal site?</b> Import them by going to <a href="http://www.hackster.io/projects/new">the showcase page</a> and entering the article URL at the bottom.</li>
    <li><b>Starting from scratch?</b> <a href="http://www.hackster.io/projects/new">Creating a project is super easy</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  The team and I are excited to see what you've done!
</p>

<p>Let me know if you need any help.</p>

<p>Cheers,<br>
  Ben<br>
