            h2.text-center.mg-20 Hackster Powers the Hardware Community
            p We started in 2013 with a commitment to help people everywhere learn how to program, connect and create Internet-connected hardware. Soon, our community will have surpassed 100,000 developers, makers and entrepreneurs who build projects as means for learning and discovery.

            p We put people and learning ahead of commercial interests, and weâ€™ve built an amazing network of partners who believe in our mission: if we do our job right, Hackster will accelerate the solving of really big problems. By equipping inventive people with the resources they need, we hope to help them create technologies that impact meaningful issues, such as a healthy environment, wildlife preservation, and our own welfare.
