    p
      | Hackster, Inc. (“Hackster”) opererates the Hackster.io website. It is Hackster's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites. The following privacy policy apply only to the websites above, for the privacy policies of other Hackster services please consult the individual privacy policies of those other services.

    h2 Website Visitors
    p
      | Like most website operators, Hackster collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Hackster's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Hackster's visitors use its website. From time to time, Hackster may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
    p
      | Hackster also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and e-mail addresses. Hackster does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
    p You hereby agree to the registration and use of information described above.

    h2 Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
    p
      | Certain visitors to Hackster's websites choose to interact with Hackster in ways that require Hackster to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Hackster gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at Hackster.io to provide a username and email address. Signed up users also have the possibility to display additional personal information on their profile such as real name, location or one-sentence biography. In each case, Hackster collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Hackster. Hackster does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
    p You hereby agree to the registration and use of information described above.

    h2 Aggregated Statistics
    p
      | Hackster may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Hackster may monitor the most popular projects on the Hackster.io site. Hackster may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Hackster does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

    h2 Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
    p
      | Hackster discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Hackster's behalf or to provide services available at Hackster's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Hackster's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Hackster will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Hackster discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Hackster believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Hackster, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Hackster website and have supplied your email address, Hackster may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Hackster and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Hackster takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

    h2 International Transfers
    p
      | Hackster products and services may be provided using resources and servers located in various countries around the world. Therefore your personal data may be transferred across international borders outside the country where you use our services, including to countries that have different legal rules on data protection, for example United States of America. In such cases we take appropriate steps to ensure adequate protection for your personal data, for example by using standard agreements approved by relevant authorities and by requiring the use of other appropriate technical and organizational information security measures.
    p You have the right to inspect what information is registered about you and to correct any errors in such information.

    h2 Cookies
    p
      | A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Hackster uses cookies to help Hackster identify and track visitors, their usage of Hackster's websites, and their website access preferences. Hackster visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Hackster's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Hackster's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

    h2 Data Storage
    p
      | Hackster uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run Hackster.io.

    h2#whitelabel Whitelabel Communities Powered by Hackster.io
    p
      | Hackster provides hosted services for other companies (called "Platforms" on Hackster.io) that want their own project-sharing site. These sites use a subset of the projects and profile data that is available on Hackster.io. Consequently, if you're following a specific platform, or create a project and tag it with that platform, or respect, or comment on such a project, your profile information will appear on that platform's whitelabel project-sharing site (if they have one). It's important to note that we do not share your data with these companies in any way; all of it remains on our servers.

    h2 Privacy Policy Changes
    p
      | Although most changes are likely to be minor, Hackster may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Hackster's sole discretion. However, if this Privacy Policy is changed in a material, adverse way, Hackster will post a notice advising of such change at the beginning of this policy and on the homepage for 30 days. Hackster encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.

    h2#third-party Third party services
    p
      | Because we want to be able to focus on building a great product, we have outsourced most of the server-side components to third party services. Pieces of your data might be transferred to them as part of normal operations, but never as the result of an agreement to exchange data. For sake of transparency, below is the list of all the third party services we use:
